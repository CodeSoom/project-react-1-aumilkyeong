        <h2>How Progression Work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              You cannot adjust the difficulty of bodyweight exercises like with weight training
              by simply adding or removing plates of weight. Therefore, in order to effectively
              increase or decrease the difficulty, you need to use different variations of
              a type of exercise. For an example in the push-up progression, some people may find
              a push-up on its own too difficult, and some may find it too easy.
              Therefore, variations of the pushup exist to make it easer (e.g. incline push-ups)
              or harder (decline, diamond, ring, pseudo planche etc. push-ups) so that you can pick
              a variation that is appropriate to your strength level, rather than simply doing
              an exercise that may be far too easy to make you get stronger,
              or far too hard to do properly.
            </p>
          </li>

              When you get to the strength training, you will be greeted with progression exercises
              listed in order of increasing difficulty. Pick an appropriately difficult progression
              for your current level of strength, and perform 3 sets of 5 reps of that progresssion
              on your first session. In subsequent sessions you should try to add one rep per set
              until you are performing 3 sets of 8 reps with good form. From here you should move on
              to the next progression, but again at 3 sets of 5 reps. Note that this means that you
              only perform one of the exercises from each of the listed progressions in each
              session. Once you move up in the progression, there&#39;s no need to keep the easier
              exercises in your routine (except for using it as a warm-up if you feel like it).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Some of the exercises are static holds, such as the support holds or the
              &#34;tuck front lever&#34; in the rowing progression. Instead of dynamic reps,
              one set here consists of simply holding the position statically
              for 10-30 seconds. Move on to the next harder progression once you hit
              30 seconds for all 3 sets.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You&#39;ll see there are multiple &#34;progression paths&#34; for the exercises.
              However, don&#39;t overthink this - if you&#39;re not sure pick the main progression
              and do it. If for some reason you can&#39;t follow the main progression
              (lack of specific equipment, for example) then pick one of the
              alternatives and do it.
